    descripton:
      "Very light oak influence allows the elevated, sun-soaked terroir of Mount Veeder to shine. Acidity is bright, and the wine has tart, juicy black fruits. Herbs and black licorice add nuance, while chewy tannins persist in a lingering finish, which is rich in stony mineral notes. If over-extracted Napa Cabs turned you away from the variety and region, this bottle promises to lure you back in. The 2014 vintage isdrinking exceptionally well, but it’s still a baby. This wine will mature with grace and elegance and can be left in the cellar for decades.",

    descripton:
      "German-born Hermann J. Wiemer was a pioneer of viticulture and winemaking in New York’s Finger Lakes region. In 2003, his apprentice Fred Merwath took over the winery, along with Merwath’s college friend and now co-owner, Oskar Bynke. The pair are now making the region’s most exciting wines, growing grapes without pesticides and herbicides, and slowly fermenting wines over periods of eight months or more. Grapes for this bottle come from the HJW vineyard, whose aged vines benefit from the moderating effects of nearby Seneca Lake. The site’s elevation also provides a cool, prolonged growing season, meaning grapes mature with intensity and finesse and maintain fresh fruit flavors and bracing acidity. This bottle has green apple, white peach, and lemon notes, followed by alasting, crisp finish. Dry, age-worthy, and absolutely delicious, this is the most stunning Riesling currently being made in America.",

    descripton:
      "Norwegian billionaire Alexander Vik founded an eponymous Chilean winery with the modest aim of creating the best wine in South America. In 2006, after years of extensive planning, research, and soil analysis, he purchased an 11,000-acre estate in the Millahue Valley. Viña Vik’s flagship Millahue blend contains Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from three different vine clones, planted across three plots. Smaller quantities of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Syrah, and Carménère complete the wine. The 2013 vintage more than delivers on Vik’s vision, with dark berry aromas, followed by dried herbs and floral notes. Bright and energetic on the palate, with spicy tannins, this is a polished wine capable of aging. Not only is this now South America’s best wine, it ranks among the finest bottles we tasted all year.",

    descripton:
      "An acidic, black grape, Xinomavro wines are powerful and highly tannic. Grapes for Kir-Yianni Estate’s Ramnista come from carefully selected vineyards whose low pH soils produce expressive, concentrated wines. The 2013 vintage is intensely aromatic, with flavors of dark fruit, leather, olives, and herbs. Grippy tannins work alongside racy acidity in this $25 bottle that will age well for 10 to 15 years at least. This wine proves that Greek Xinomavro can hang with the likes of Barolo and Pinot Noir. This is one variety to watch over the next couple of years.",

      "Arianna Occhipinti “SP68” Rosso is a tangy, gluggable red from Sicily’s Vittoria region. In recent years, regional producers like Occhipinti have led the charge for terroir-driven, organic winemaking using local grapes like Nero d’Avola and Frappato. The unfiltered “SP68” Rosso is an approachable wine, with a mix of tart cranberry, strawberry, and cherry fruits. Earth and savory herbs come through as well, adding depth and complexity. The palate is similar to the nose — light, lip-smacking, and savory.",

It has a beautiful ruby color and quintessential Barolo aromas of roses plus a hint of leather and mushrooms. Rusted iron and savory, herbal spices come through on the palate, and it finishes with punchy tannins.",
